## Gunnar Magnussen
My name is Gunnar and I make games. Making games includes so many interesting art forms and I find that the people who share this hobby are usually super interesting and amazing people. Other forms of making I also enjoy include: drawing, painting, video editing, sewing and cosplay.

I have a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and am currently pursuing a MSc in Games on the technology track at the IT University of Copenhagen.

What draws me to the technical side of game development is the creative challenge of making many different individual parts come together to create a whole. I particularly enjoy the attention to detail and the technical knowledge this requires. Moreover, I enjoy being part of the creative environment that game development takes place in.

Skills: C# / C++ / Unity / UE5 / Game Development / Computer Graphics

### QA Tester Intern at BetaDwarf (2021 - 2022)

At BetaDwarf I gained knowledge and experience with agile development, and how games are developed and kept stable throughout continuous expansions. I performed various tasks including manual testing, interacting with users and writing automated tests. I got to work on three different projects in three different key parts of development: early, close to release, and released with regular updates. I also gained valuable insight into how games are made in a professional setting, and exactly what competencies are required of the best programmers in this industry.
Here is a letter of recommendation I received from the Executive Producer and Designer at BetaDwarf:

This is a passion project with about 20 people working on it, being developed in Unreal Engine and features a blend of 2D and 3D art assets.
I like to stay well organized and know that that is especially important for big projects, such as this one. Because there are so many people involved, it was necessary to have some leadership structure, so, after I had been with the studio for a few months, I was promoted to lead programmer for my organizational skill, as well as my knowledge of how to handle bigger projects. As the lead programmer I participate in leadership meetings, lead the programmer scrum meetings and keep an overview of the whole project from a technical perspective, ensuring best practices and standards as well as making sure that all the programmers follow a structure that will lead us to produce a good game. I also spent much of my time on the project implementing functionalities and other general development tasks. For example, I implemented a system for what way the character should be facing in the sprite image, based on the unit orientation and camera orientation.

A short coding challenge developed in Unity over a weekend. The objective was to make a basic game where the player can shoot arrows at a target, focusing on making the hit feel really good to the player. To make shooting feel good, I put emphasis on  hit effects and on controls, making it easy to aim and providing a feeling of control.

I participated in the Global Game Jam together with 5 other people.
I have participated in various game jams including Ludum Dare for individuals, and jams for teams, such as Global Game Jam, Nordic Game Jam, and FÃ¸roya Tele Game Jam, which is a game jam in the Faroe Islands that I participated in from the first time it was held in 2013 and until I moved to Denmark for my studies.

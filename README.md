## Gunnar Magnussen
My name is Gunnar and I make games. Making games includes so many interesting art forms and I find that the people who share this hobby are usually super interesting and amazing people. Other forms of making I also enjoy include: drawing, painting, video editing, sewing and cosplay.

I have a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and am currently pursuing a MSc in Games on the technology track at the IT University of Copenhagen.

What draws me to the technical side of game development is the creative challenge of making many different individual parts come together to create a whole. I particularly enjoy the attention to detail and the technical knowledge this requires. Moreover, I enjoy being part of the creative environment that game development takes place in.

Skills: C# / C++ / Unity / UE5 / Game Development / Computer Graphics

## Portfolio
### QA Tester Intern at BetaDwarf
At BetaDwarf I gained knowledge and experience with agile development, and how games are developed and kept stable throughout continuous expansions. I performed various tasks including manual testing, interacting with users and writing automated tests. I got to work on three different projects in three different key parts of development: early, close to release, and released with regular updates. I also gained valuable insight into how games are made in a professional setting, and exactly what competencies are required of the best programmers in this industry.
While working for BetaDwarf I made new connections with the people working there, resulting in possible job offers once I finish my education, as well as being friends with people that are interested in and knowledgable about game development. Here is a letter of recommendation I received from the Executive Producer and Designer at BetaDwarf:

## Hello
I am currently studying towards my MSc in Games on the technology track at ITU, which I will finish in the summer of 2025. My main programming languages are **C++ and C#** and my areas of expertise are **gameplay and graphics**. I have a lot of experience with the **Unity engine**, but have also used various other engines, such as **Unreal Engine** and **proprietary engines**.

Take a look at my [portfolio](https://raestkjoot.github.io/portfolio.github.io/)!

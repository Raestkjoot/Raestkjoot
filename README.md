My name is Gunnar and I make games. Making games includes so many interesting art forms and I find that the people who share this hobby are usually super interesting and amazing people. Other forms of making I also enjoy include: drawing, painting, video editing, sewing and cosplay.

I have a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and am currently pursuing a MSc in Games on the technology track at the IT University of Copenhagen.

What draws me to the technical side of game development is the creative challenge of making many different individual parts come together to create a whole. I particularly enjoy the attention to detail and the technical knowledge this requires. Moreover, I enjoy being part of the creative environment that game development takes place in.
